## It's a joke
So I don't actually think this is an epidemic. I just think it's funny. There have been many times when I will see people with AirDrop on and feel like sending them something. Now...I get to!

## How about some Q&A?

### But why?
I know there are a lot of other things to do but this was fun. It took about as long as watching a movie and it took me back to the evenings in the summer when I'd build a new treehouse just because I could.

### So what is it anyway?
Just a site. That's it.

### And that logo?
Just for fun.

### So it's just for fun?
Yup...like building a treehouse.
