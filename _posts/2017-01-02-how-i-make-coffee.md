I've had a lot of people ask me about how I make my coffee. Being a massive coffee nerd (I have more than 4 textbook style books on coffee and its chemistry) people seem to think that making my morning coffee could be equated to launching the Space Shuttle. I can assure that it is not.

Here is a super simple step-by-step inspired by Marco Arment from [this podcast](http://engineered.network/pragmatic/episode-30-coffee). This is how I make my coffee using an [Aeropress](http://amzn.to/2j1XgUM) every morning.

## 1. Water
Coffee is 98% water. Use good water. Boil it and let it cool for a few seconds (maybe 40...it depends on how much water...use a thermometer if you want to get technical). The key is to not burn your coffee.

## 2. Grind your coffee
Grind is so important. If you don't have a good grinder have them grind your coffee at your local coffee shop. I'll nerd out in another post about my Breville Grinder but of the grinders that I have tried the [Dose Control Pro](http://amzn.to/2iYdnyC) is the best bang for your buck that I've found.

For the Aeropress, I've found that sand-like is fitting. On my grinder this is around "15" but your mileage may vary.

## 3. Dose your coffee
I think Coffee should be weighed. Not dosed by timed or done with a scoop. Weighed. Every bag of coffee is going to offer different volumes or will be slower through your grinder so the only way to consistently brew your coffee is by using a scale.

This is not what is prescribed by Aeropress or other sources but I really like 10 grams at the "3 line" and 12 grams at the "4 line". That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I'm not super *super* particular about this. Within a gram and I'm happy.

## 4. Pour the water.
I do what I've heard called "the inverted Aeropress method" where you have the plunger side of the press on the counter (numbers upside-down). I feel like it's simpler and doesn't taste any worse (yup, tried both, like this method better).

I pour about half-way up the Aeropress and then I stir (or swirl) in order to wet all the grounds. Then I pour up to the top (or gosh-darn-close). Too close and you'll spill everywhere, though.

</div>

I'll also quickly rinse off the filter. This isn't to "get rid of the paper taste" that some say you get from the filters. I personally can't taste it. I do this to keep the filter attached to the cap. Pure ergonomics.

## 5. Cover + Plunge
This is yet another example of my rebel lifestyle. I hardly let the Aeropress sit more than a minute, or just enough time to warm up my mug or thermos. I finish filling the Aeropress and then I pour hot water into my mug if I'm staying home or travel mug if I'm commuting to the office.

I typically will count to 10 and then dump the water out of my mug and then press the Aeropress in. Simple, fast, done.

</div>

## 6. Cleanup
The cleanup for the Aeropress is amazing. You take off the filter cap, "pop" the puck into your rubbish, and after a quick rinse, you're done.

## Tada
There you go. That's how I do it. I hope this helps you out. ...and if you were sent here by me if you asked me how I brew my coffee I assure you that it wasn't a passive aggressive link-share.
