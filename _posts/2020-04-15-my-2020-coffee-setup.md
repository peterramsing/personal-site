A few years ago I <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-i-make-my-morning-coffee" target="_blank">wrote about how I brewed my coffee in the morning</a>. Honest, I have more gear now but I often revert back to the simpler times with just my AreoPress. That said, I've changed things up a bit and I couldn't be happier.

## Brewed Coffee
In the past I've always brewed coffee with either a pour-over or AreoPress. I loved it. When my wife and I found out we were expecting twins I decided that an automatic brewer would be a helpful addition to our coffee setup. I chose the <a href="https://amzn.to/3a5VeZW" target="_blank">Breville Precision Brewer</a> because of its versatility. I can do cold-brew, 12 cups on Thanksgiving, and a quick cup when I'm wanting a pick-me-up in the afternoon. It covers it all and it does it well. Additionally, I love Breville's product-line and as someone who's brand loyal to a fault it felt like a great option.

After using it for about six months now both my wife and I wouldn't go back. We set it to brew almost every evening after we feed the kids and put them down. I highly recommend the carafe version as it'll keep your coffee warm and won't risk burning the coffee with a warmer.

## Espresso
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-i-make-my-morning-coffee" target="_blank">Last we chatted about brewing</a>, I had a "Starbucks Barista" (by Saeco). I loved that machine but I was ready for an upgrade. At the time I'd been going back and forth on several models and settled on the <a href="https://amzn.to/2z5HQIv" target="_blank">Breville Infuser BES840XL</a>. It's a single-boiler but it does just fine for lattes for my wife and I on the weekends. I'm often using it for hot chocolates in the evenings and sometimes will have a small cappuccino in the afternoons. Additionally my wife and I are often caught making tea from the water spout. It's not as hot as tea usually likes but the convenience factor is amazing!

## Grinders
I am still using the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XPTv8L" target="_blank">Breville Dose Control Pro</a> and I have it dialed in for the espresso machine. It's been fantastic and after about 5 years of using it daily it's continued to perform terrific. We added the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XPTQIz" target="_blank">Breville Smart Grinder Pro</a> to the fold of grinders as we were often having several coffees on deck and dialing them in constantly was rough (first-world-problems, for sure). I chose the upgrade to experiment whether I'd like it or not and I do believe it's worth the $30 more over the Dose Pro.
