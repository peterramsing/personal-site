Often I'll want to see the difference between two releases on GitHub. Typically there is a CHANGELOG that will tell me a between versions but what if I want to see a diff between two versions that aren't sequential? GitHub offers a way to do this.

I've been adding a link to the actual code diffs between versions in my [LostGrid Changelist](https://github.com/peterramsing/lost/releases/tag/v7.0.3) for each release and I haven't seen many other examples of this.

Today I needed to see the diff between our current version or [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) and the latest version. Because we were behind a few versions it wasn't as simple as looking at the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) so I used the `compare` tool. It's same place you would go to create a Pull Request but it also allows you to compare between tags. I find it easiest is to use the `URL` to perform the comparison.

## So how?

https://github.com/`user`/`repo`/`beginning-tag`...`ending-tag`

The key is that "..." and knowing the tags. I typically start at the release page and go from there. The GIF below explains it. üëçüèª
