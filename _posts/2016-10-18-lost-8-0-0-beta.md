## LostGrid has a beta! <a href="https://github.com/peterramsing/lost/releases/tag/v8.0.0-beta.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(v8.0.0-beta.0)</a>

This first release has a new more intuitive version of `lost-offset` that now shifts the content a bit more like you'd feel it should. Negative fractions moves it to the left and positive fractions move it to the right. It feels great to use!
