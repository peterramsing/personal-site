###So, here's the truth...

I've written lots of things, several of them were actually pretty good. Years ago I used to write a blog. Years ago I used to care how many people read it. Years ago I used to wonder if people liked me. I've changed.

####What's this about then?
I'm not sure. But several days ago I was writing out a few things in my journal and for the first time in a long time I thought about putting some of them online...but not for pageviews. You see, I've lost my ego (or at least I'm trying). That's what this is about.

So, my target audience? Me. That's not my ego (because I lost that, right? ðŸ˜‰)-but simply that this is place for me to write and if it makes its way to others and they enjoy it, great.

Alright-that's it for me right now.
