# Peter Ramsing, the&nbsp;Paid&nbsp;Version

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/my-work/">Want to see my work?</a>

## What I do:
I build web sites and applications for small to medium size businesses and startups working with teams wherever they are. Whether it's inception or it's a legacy codebase I identify efficient solutions to complex business problems and deliver value quickly back to the organization.


## How I do it:
The goal is to deliver working software quickly and regularly. I work with teams to fit into their process but typically work in sprints delivering a working website or app at the end of each sprint.


## Investment:
I am $100 an hour. What you get for those hours is high value and focused work. A small three or four page site with copy, design, and development is typically a several thousand dollar investment, and more complex apps can jump up from there.
