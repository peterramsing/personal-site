---

Iâ€™m a web developer with 3 years experience successfully delivering results for small to medium sized companies. Skilled at developing complete web applications from scratch and integrating small apps with larger legacy systems, I deliver quality and maintainable code quickly and consistently.

I have effectively taken large legacy table based sites and migrated them to responsive design using modern tooling while working with product owners to stay under-budget and on-time working with extremely tight deadlines.

As a maintainer of the largest grid framework for PostCSS, LostGrid, I also have had the privilege of working with and learning from amazing developers from all over the globe every single day. I am a strong team player and am experienced in-office and remote.
