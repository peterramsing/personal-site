    <h3 id="so-heres-the-truth">So, hereâ€™s the truthâ€¦</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve written lots of things, several of them were actually pretty good. Years ago I used to write a blog. Years ago I used to care how many people read it. Years ago I used to wonder if people liked me. Iâ€™ve changed.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="whats-this-about-then">Whatâ€™s this about then?</h4>
<p>Iâ€™m not sure. But several days ago I was writing out a few things in my journal and for the first time in a long time I thought about putting some of them onlineâ€¦but not for pageviews. You see, Iâ€™ve lost my ego (or at least Iâ€™m trying). Thatâ€™s what this is about.</p>

<p>So, my target audience? Me. Thatâ€™s not my ego (because I lost that, right? ðŸ˜‰)-but simply that this is place for me to write and if it makes its way to others and they enjoy it, great.</p>

<p>Alright-thatâ€™s it for me right now.</p>
