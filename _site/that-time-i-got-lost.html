  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Last week I got Lost. Oh-gosh–not that type of lost! I have <a href="http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com">Apple Maps</a> for that. I did get the PostCSS grid called <a href="https://github.com/peterramsing/lost">LostGrid</a> <a href="https://github.com/peterramsing/lost/issues/203">transferred</a> to my GitHub user.</p>

<p>Getting a repo transferred has its challenges. I had only submitted some pull requests but didn’t write the underlying code. I had a lot to learn. Here’s some highlights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quickly fly to the 30,000 foot view</strong>
  When I first took over the repo I didn’t really touch much code. I wanted to fully understand everything. I even sifted through all the issues (included closed issues) so that my understanding was full. I did a lot of abstract writing about the project, too. Just me and my notepad. I had to fight my inner desire to open up Atom and type away like a madman. That wasn’t what the repo needed just yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organize</strong>
  Lost Grid didn’t have any milestones or a tagging strategy before me. This meant that I had the freedom to implement in the way that I felt was best for the project. I’m a fan of the system that I saw in the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/labels">Angular</a> project so I went that direction. I opened issues to express what I was planning to do and added milestones to show even more clear direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Read</strong>
  I read so much in the first days of having the LostGrid repo. I read through the PostCSS docs as LostGrid relies on it for its core functionality. I read through all the existing code and wrote a lot of notes on it. I sifted through the existing documentation and even started to traverse back into the commit history to see previous direction. LostGrid is on version 6, that means there is a lot of history–even though the project is so young.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write</strong>
  I wrote so much in my notepad and in text files cluttering my desktop. I had to get down everything that I was thinking. I found this was really valuable as it helped me cull down what I felt was really important and what was just passing thoughts. I reviewed my notes each evening when I sat down to get “Lost” for a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reach Out</strong>
  I commented a lot within the issues a lot and started Tweeting. I wanted to get to know other people who were working on the repo as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep Looking Around</strong>
  This was a new shiny ball! Weee! I didn’t want to lose sight of the web around me, though. This is the web we’re talking about. Four JS frameworks came out yesterday (I hear they’re good). I made a point to keep looking at other things in the web to ensure that I had good context for the general direction of the web.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slow Down</strong>
  Just because I want to change something in the repo doesn’t mean that I should. The codebase is working and people are using it. I need to ensure that I’m getting the priorities correct before releasing version after version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Go For Runs</strong>
  …and watch funny movies. Basically, to follow up with item 6: I didn’t want to let the shiny new ball distract me from my life (even though my wife might say it did let it distract me). On my run this morning I came up with some pretty creative solutions to some hard issues. While watching an episode of Elementary I paused and wrote down some ideas that came to me. While reading the WSJ I wrote in the margins of a page to follow up on another idea. During a drive to the Oregon Coast a feature came to mind. I needn’t get lost in Lost.</p>
