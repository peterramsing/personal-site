        <p class="post-meta">February 7, 2016</p>
        <p>Preparing for life should be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>
          <p>In 2012 the astronauts aboard the International Space Station were awakened in the middle of the night by a fire alarm. All six of the crew members on board quickly, but not rushed, made their way to the central portion* of the space station to assess the situation and fight the fire. Thankfully this was an instrumentation failure and there was no fire aboard and all were able to back to sleep. Throughout the time while they “warn, gather, work”, Astronaut Chris Hadfield recalls in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astronauts-Guide-Life-Earth-Determination/dp/0316253030">his book</a> that he remembers the entire episode was calm with their heart rates hardly beating any faster. Their lives might have been in serious jeopardy but this was routine. They were prepared.</p>

<p>While this is both an awesome nerdy fact it is also a great lesson to bring back to earth. While I believe this is something that can be taken into the ops world (which I try to do at work) I actually think this has struck a deeper chord in my spiritual life.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://allisonramsing.com">wife</a> and I are currently on an adventure to be a part of a church plant in Portland, Oregon. While this is exciting and something we are very excited about it is becoming more and more aware that we need to be prepared. That means ensuring we have our move planned well but more deeply, and a certain life change for sure, is the ever-more present need to study as the astronauts do. Tirelessly, relentlessly, and with every part of ourselves.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I have known about God and believed in Him. With certain ups-and-downs in our closeness, I have never fully embraced the importance of truly studying the Bible, God’s Word. In recalling this story about the fire on the ISS it hit me like a ton of bricks. <strong>The devil is going to actively be trying to stop our adventure and are we prepared to be calm and trust in the truth and rely on God?</strong></p>

<p>Just as the astronauts were able to rely on their training and knowledge and trust it I need to be training and studying so that when the devil tries to trip us up we can remain calm and trust in God instead of reacting.</p>

        <p class="post-meta">February 4, 2016</p>
        <p>My journey from contributor to maintainer.</p>
        <p>
          <p>Last week I got Lost. Oh-gosh–not that type of lost! I have <a href="http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com">Apple Maps</a> for that. I did get the PostCSS grid called <a href="https://github.com/peterramsing/lost">LostGrid</a> <a href="https://github.com/peterramsing/lost/issues/203">transferred</a> to my GitHub user.</p>

<p>Getting a repo transferred has its challenges. I had only submitted some pull requests but didn’t write the underlying code. I had a lot to learn. Here’s some highlights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quickly fly to the 30,000 foot view</strong>
  When I first took over the repo I didn’t really touch much code. I wanted to fully understand everything. I even sifted through all the issues (included closed issues) so that my understanding was full. I did a lot of abstract writing about the project, too. Just me and my notepad. I had to fight my inner desire to open up Atom and type away like a madman. That wasn’t what the repo needed just yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organize</strong>
  Lost Grid didn’t have any milestones or a tagging strategy before me. This meant that I had the freedom to implement in the way that I felt was best for the project. I’m a fan of the system that I saw in the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/labels">Angular</a> project so I went that direction. I opened issues to express what I was planning to do and added milestones to show even more clear direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Read</strong>
  I read so much in the first days of having the LostGrid repo. I read through the PostCSS docs as LostGrid relies on it for its core functionality. I read through all the existing code and wrote a lot of notes on it. I sifted through the existing documentation and even started to traverse back into the commit history to see previous direction. LostGrid is on version 6, that means there is a lot of history–even though the project is so young.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write</strong>
  I wrote so much in my notepad and in text files cluttering my desktop. I had to get down everything that I was thinking. I found this was really valuable as it helped me cull down what I felt was really important and what was just passing thoughts. I reviewed my notes each evening when I sat down to get “Lost” for a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reach Out</strong>
  I commented a lot within the issues a lot and started Tweeting. I wanted to get to know other people who were working on the repo as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep Looking Around</strong>
  This was a new shiny ball! Weee! I didn’t want to lose sight of the web around me, though. This is the web we’re talking about. Four JS frameworks came out yesterday (I hear they’re good). I made a point to keep looking at other things in the web to ensure that I had good context for the general direction of the web.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slow Down</strong>
  Just because I want to change something in the repo doesn’t mean that I should. The codebase is working and people are using it. I need to ensure that I’m getting the priorities correct before releasing version after version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Go For Runs</strong>
  …and watch funny movies. Basically, to follow up with item 6: I didn’t want to let the shiny new ball distract me from my life (even though my wife might say it did let it distract me). On my run this morning I came up with some pretty creative solutions to some hard issues. While watching an episode of Elementary I paused and wrote down some ideas that came to me. While reading the WSJ I wrote in the margins of a page to follow up on another idea. During a drive to the Oregon Coast a feature came to mind. I needn’t get lost in Lost.</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/a-plan-for-deploy.html">A Plan For Deploy</a></h2>
        <p class="post-meta">December 28, 2015</p>
        <p>Deploying our new TrackIR Site.</p>
        <p>
          <p>Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a>. So when this last week we got the thumbs up from the CEO and were ready to deploy our <a href="http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/">new site</a>, I wanted to make sure that the deploy went as smooth as possible and kept decision fatigue in mind.</p>

<p>Whenever one deploys to an older codebase there is a risk that something goes wrong. We have testing environments but our older code can sometimes find its way to cause issues that we can’t spot on Staging or in Testing. When we started on the new site weeks before I began the planning process to ensure that the night of the deploy I was ready to think and make the decisions that I needed to make, not ones that could be thought of before the deploy.</p>

<p>The actual deploy consisted of very few steps to get the new code live. First, put the new code on the server and second add some aliases to the apache config. There were two goals in mind when doing this “simple” deploy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain uptime of all critical processes on all four web properties.</li>
  <li>Be able to roll back at any point in the deploy ~~if~~ when something goes wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have four web properties touching the same backend code to manage their cart and checkout process. Luckily we weren’t dealing with anything new in the database so that wasn’t an added step.</p>

<p>Here’s an abbreviated version of what my decision tree looked like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build out NaturalPoint V2 Production Jenkins Item.
    <ul>
      <li>ssh into server and verify the files are in order and symlinks are in spec.
        <ul>
          <li><em>if not</em>
            <ul>
              <li>verify that the site is still functioning and then review Jenkins cofig–go back to start.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>if yes</em>
            <ul>
              <li>proceed</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Deploy new Puppet config to production server
    <ul>
      <li>Test if new site is visible on <a href="www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/">www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/</a>
        <ul>
          <li><em>if not</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Is the site up at at all?
                <ul>
                  <li><em>if it’s still on old site</em>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Review the apache configs on production via ssh and determine if they were adjusted. Work with Puppet script to resolve the issue.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>*if the site is not available at all
                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Immediately</em> roll the apache config change back with Puppet - verify site is back to old codebase. Review apache change and start over.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><em>if the site is up on new codebase</em>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Test to ensure server includes are working, store is working, checkout is operational, etc.</li>
                      <li><em>if any tests fail</em> Immediately roll back apache change. Test again on old codebase and if it still doesn’t work Build out NaturalPoint V1 Production Jenkins Item–this will revert all code back to previous state.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>etc, etc, etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting 22:30 last Monday I got on the phone with our remote IT chap who would be managing the apache configs as we have our production server managed by Puppet which is in the brilliant hands of some gents offsite. The night went a lot longer than expected and while there were a few tense moments there was never a question about the stability or availability of the critical services. Because of the thinking went into the planning I didn’t need to worry about “should we roll back?” or “is this right?”, it was already known.</p>

<p>So what if it took twelve times longer than if everything went off without a hitch? It’s unavoidable when you’re in dev/ops. Because there was a solid plan in place there wasn’t much stress. When I finally crawled in bed early the next morning I wasn’t trying to calm my brain. There was a plan, it was executed, and the decisions were made ahead of time not right in the thick.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>When you have the decisions already made you leave your head clear to make the decisions that need to be made on the fly much more educated and well processed.</p>

          <h3 id="so-heres-the-truth">So, here’s the truth…</h3>

<p>I’ve written lots of things, several of them were actually pretty good. Years ago I used to write a blog. Years ago I used to care how many people read it. Years ago I used to wonder if people liked me. I’ve changed.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="whats-this-about-then">What’s this about then?</h4>
<p>I’m not sure. But several days ago I was writing out a few things in my journal and for the first time in a long time I thought about putting some of them online…but not for pageviews. You see, I’ve lost my ego (or at least I’m trying). That’s what this is about.</p>

<p>So, my target audience? Me. That’s not my ego (because I lost that, right? 😉)-but simply that this is place for me to write and if it makes its way to others and they enjoy it, great.</p>

<p>Alright-that’s it for me right now.</p>
