## Great thoughts from the discussion:
* Mentors are an amazing way to learn, get feedback and improve in all areas of your life. Seek them out.
* Be a mentor!
  * No really...you can be a mentor now!
* Regarding "Checking your ego at the door":
  * It was suggested that I should define "check you ego at the door" a little more. He shared, and I'm paraphrasing, "There was an expert *(and I mean a real expert)* in our group for weeks before we found out. Weeks went by when they could have shared their hardâ€“earned expertise from their prestigious role but were to humble to share. We lost out as a group because they were too shy to share what they had, which was a lot, and we all were bummed." **Being humble does not mean shoving your skills aside and being silent.**
  * C.S. Lewis [put it well](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/201236-true-humility-is-not-thinking-less-of-yourself-it-is): *"True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less."*

I made a full reading list [here]({{ site.baseurl }}reading-list).

## That List at the end:
1. Ask someone who you are
2. Identify your wins & loses
3. Have a mission for yourself
4. Start blogging + talk
5. Check your ego at the door

## Some of those quotes from the slides:
> We all have something to offer.

> The greatest enemy of the best is a lot of good.

> The best way to learn is to teach. - {someone}

## The Slide Deck
My style of slide deck is very minimal so they don't stand up very well by themselves without the context. But...if you want to see them they are <a target="_blank" href="/static/talks/five-steps-devsigner-2016">here</a>. *Sorry the italics are bit off...Keynote exported them like that.*
