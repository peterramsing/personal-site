Simplify for the developer. (you!) Put yourself first and not the code. Optimize for yourself.
Evolve the system. Starting at the beginning trying to predict where the site/project is going can be difficult. I typically prescribe starting small and grow as you need. Do not try to predict the site’s needs a month from now. Code in the present.
I suppose it’s important to also say to not be foolish and write bad code. Follow good standards and code so you don’t have to refactor later. The key is to start small and grow as the needs grow instead of trying to predict your future needs in detail.
 Let the design dictate the grid. 12 columns is a “standard” but why? Some sites I’ve worked on have 6 columns. Others have 2 columns. Don’t let others define your needs for you. Define your needs for yourself.
Avoid clever code. Clever code is hard to maintain. Well written simple code is easy to maintain. That doesn’t mean you avoid complexity or creative solutions. But remember that you need to come back and work on the same code tomorrow. Comment inline in your code if you feel that the code doesn’t self document itself.
A little rule I have for myself is to realize whenever I use a negative margin. Typically negative margin is the sign for me that I’m getting too clever and I either need to write comments to explain myself or I need to try again.
Simple, organized code that is readable will always win over complex code.
Beware of specificity. Avoid nesting and try using data-attributes to specify special elements. Having well organized HTML is key here. Simplify wherever you can.
