# Setting the Stage
I started working on software by hacking it together. It was messy but it go the job done. We all start somewhere and this is where I started. It's when I started working on code I'd previous written and realized that it's hard to return to old code I knew there had to be a better way. Add to the mix the need to work on teams and I was desperate for a better way. For some reason I tried to just "write better code" but recently I learned the "better way" and it was obvious at first sight.

# Design before you code
